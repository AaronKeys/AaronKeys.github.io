        <h2>Problem-statement: Time Management App for Computer Science Students</h2>
        <p>
          Computer science students at universities often face challenges in time management
          when dealing with intensive programming projects and theoretical assignments. 
          They need a time management app that helps plan short-term and long-term academic 
          tasks and provides custom reminders and progress tracking. This app should be simple to use, 
          seamlessly integrating with their daily study routines, thus helping them improve learning efficiency, 
          reduce procrastination, and complete high-quality academic task within strict deadlines.

          Time Management Storyboard: The story of Thomas Rogers using the time management app for computer science students and completing his work on time.
          1.Thomas Goes to his college in the morning
          2.He attends his first computer science class and realizes he has to keep track of his assignments.
          3.He realizes finding an application to keep track of his assignmetns would be great and begins his search.
          4.Thomas finds a time management app for computer science students and downloads it.
          5.He goes through his checklist of assignments and transfers them to his new application.
          6.Thomas is able to get all his work done on time, because he was able to keep track of his assignments more efficiently.
