        <h2>Problem-statement: Time Management App for Computer Science Students</h2>
        <p>
          Computer science students at universities often face challenges in time management
          when dealing with intensive programming projects and theoretical assignments. 
          They need a time management app that helps plan short-term and long-term academic 
          tasks and provides custom reminders and progress tracking. This app should be simple to use, 
          seamlessly integrating with their daily study routines, thus helping them improve learning efficiency, 
          reduce procrastination, and complete high-quality academic task within strict deadlines.

            We have the diagram broken up into six areas: Application Features and User Inferface, 
            Development and Technology, Business Model and Monetization,
            (Feedback, Growth, and Collaboration),
            Acessibility, 
            and another area that were miscellaneous.
